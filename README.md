## How To Play

Dodge Asteroids, Shoot Asteroids, Pick Up Power Ups and get the highest score possible. These are all the goals in the current game. The game starts with 5 asteroids, on the screen, and for every level you complete, 5 more will be added. Power Ups will randomly spawn on the map, between 20 and 60 seconds. These Power Ups will give you either "+1 Life", or "Ability Cooldown Reduction".
